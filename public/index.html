<h1>UW Shibboleth SPA Multiserver with Nginx proxy</h1>
<p>
  This is a SPA! Only this html file is served from the server, everything else is JSON. Visit the following routes in your browser, it's best to have a JSON viewer in your browser like Chrome's <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog">JSONView</a>
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="open.json">Open.json...no security</a></li>
  <li><a href="secure.json">Secure.json...UW Web Login with Shibboleth</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Note: The Secure.json route will return a dummy user when running the site as
localhost.  See repo readme file for full details on how to set everything up.
